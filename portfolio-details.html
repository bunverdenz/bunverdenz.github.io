				<p>Abstract
				</p>
				<p>
					Visually impaired persons often experience limited user accessibility regarding smart devices. 
					Particularly, it is challenging for such persons to precisely touch a button or icon to operate
					smart devices. Existing studies have reported a lack of step-by-step guidance for visually impaired 
					users to perform tasks on smart devices. Although prototypes and non-visual interface systems 
					were implemented to aid blind people in using mobile phones, a step-by-step guidance system
					was not developed. Moreover, devices other than smartphones were not emphasized. To address
					these limitations, we propose a novel guidance system that employs an object detection method
					for recognizing the control panels of smart devices and offers appropriate guidelines based
					on the user’s targeted task. A user study conducted with 20 participants on 3 tasks and a 
					baseline with existing voice assistants, such as Screen Reader and VoiceOver, indicated that
					users were more satisfied with our guidance system than with existing voice assistants. 
					Although the system does not perform well on small smart devices such as smartphones, 
					16 participants preferred the guiding feature of our system.

					Every day, I had to set my short-term tasks, and reviewed myself at the end of the day about what I got from each day.
					They are very very friendly! I really loved to interact, play a board game, sing a song, and a lot of fun stuffs. This place
					was really nice to me!
				</p>
				<p>And more importantly, I learned a lot about how to use many libraries and Android SDK from this company, such as Retrofit,
					DAOs, RXJava2, Dagger, and also strengthen my fundamental android knowledge such as Floating Action Button, Recycle View and many more!

				<p>This class was the best class I attended during my time at KAIST. Professor Juho Kim was very friendly, and
					his speech was very fun. I never got bored of it. This projet also taught me a lot about how to work as a team.
					And also how to deal with slowly progress from some team members. There were some problems, but it was a very nice
					experiences! I had learned a lot about Social Computing and how significant it might affect our
					real world social issues. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We started everything from ideation, sharing our ideas. That was quite a hard time coming with the best ideas for 
					us to move on, since we had different thoughts, and we needed to figure out something unique and not another Facebook 
					as Professor suggested. Then we develop our Low-fi Prototype using <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel</a>. Then,
					we moved on to High-fi Prototype with real database and front-end using React.js. Finally, we evaluated our
					own usefulness by finding volunteer users to use our platform. 
				</p>
				<p>I mostly developed about more than 40% as a backend for Firebase part and Components part, since we are 
					using React.js. We have discovered a lot of ways and knowledge about React.js, important functions such as componentDidMount,
					 redux, asynchronous task between React’s rendering and firebase data fetching to resolve those bugs. 
					 Furthermore, when we further proceeded on the implementation, a lot of new ideas such as gamification occurred.
					  Aside from that, evaluating the application through real users was a good experience to hear from real users directly 
					  and understand many different aspects from users. Something also did not go well as we expected, for instance, 
					  some of users we made an appointment forgot the appointment, took longer time than it should be, or troll around posting
					   what it was not supposed to be there (bad words). And we argued about should it be shown in the final presentation or not. 
					   This is the first time, I had to reconsider my understanding about ethical issues, since each team member have different cultures 
					   and ethical aspects. But we finally decided to vote for censoring it in the final presentation and rarely mention it. 
					   But in a nutshell, this project will be one of the best project I will never forget. :)

				<p>I had to use MySQL Language skills combining with Data Schema to develop this interface. I had learned a lot about
					backend service using MySQL with Node.js and found out that this was fun and easy using many different softwares such as
					MySQL WorkBench.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project was very difficult for me due to many circumstances. I had to study most of backend and SQL Language
					by myself using online Course and Textbook. Although that was tough, the more difficult you encountered, the more knowledge
					you get. I thought that was very good experience, since that was the first time I had to study backend service. 
					That was really fun time too!

							<h4>Research Assistant (Mining Software Repositories) Internship</h4>
							<p>An Internship at KAIST, aiming to decrease amount of time spending for identifying
								 defect-pronce files or packages which developers implemented by creating a model of
								 factors based on software change, such as number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code">LOC</a>, 
								 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy">entropy</a>. I mainly focus on following the direction of research paper especially section 2.2 (short-term quality assurance)
								  and section 3 (Change measures, predict whether changes introduce future defect or not) as shown
								 in the following research paper.
							</p>
							<ul class="list">
								<li><span>Research Paper</span>: <a href="http://www.academia.edu/30808766/A_large-scale_empirical_study_of_just-in-time_quality_assurance">Reference Paper</a></li>

								<li><span>Completed</span>: December 2018</li>
							</ul>
							
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>I used python3 with REST API to extract those metrics (factors for software change) from github repositories,
					since github is the main opensource people use nowadays, and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">Pull Requests</a> might be an issues for 
					developers which they have to spend more time reviewing, these metrics will improve this particular process,
					and we could use it to effectively decrease defect-prone softwares.
				</p>
				<p>This is my first time that I had to deal with real research paper works. I had a lot of new experiences, and it
					was also fun. Software debugging, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">Technical Debt</a>, REST API, and some of Sonar Cloud and Sonar Qube
					using Linux/Unix environments are new skills I had learned by analyzing Technical_debt and code smell. It was a very good time there!

				<p> <b>Implementing Endpoint Assertion</b> <br>
					&emsp;My assignment was to implement assertion including data transferring format from SOAP to REST and 
					REST to SOAP with <a href="https://docops.ca.com/ca-api-gateway/9-4/en">CA API Gateway 9.4</a> together with privacy such as TLS assertion. 
				</p>
				<p> 
						<b>Performance Automated Testing</b> <br>
						&emsp;Using <a href="https://jmeter.apache.org/">JMeter</a>, I can create performance statistic with simulated users requesting
						for endpoints in the order I desire. Regular Expression is also used for extracting wanted request and response. I need to contact
						test team in order to follow the scenario and use <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> or <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a>
						for extracting request from mobile phone while testing each scenario.
				</p>
				<p> 
						<b>Debugging Automated Test Script</b> <br>
						&emsp;Again, using JMeter, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana</a> (for investigating log message and error), 
						<a href="https://gravitational.com/teleport/">teleport</a> (for securely accessing data and infrastructure)
						I can debug failed test cases from JMeter from each endpoint by investigating correctness of data and conditions that JMeter used for testing.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<b>Configuring Caching and setup Apache HTTP server</b> <br>
					&emsp;In this assignment, I need to work on <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/">Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4</a> where I
					implemented configured file for AWS server. The task involved some knowledge about the structure of config file, using 
					<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_cache.html">mod_cache</a> module and <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_cache_disk.html">mod_cache_disk</a>
					module. I spent some time learning how to setup cache, this is one of the challenging tasks I got.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<b>Migrating Springboot Project to Kubernetes</b> <br>
					&emsp;Here comes the most exciting task, I had to use <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway">Spring Cloud Gateway</a> for 
					<a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a> Project where I needed to work on application.yml for configuration, Java files
					for Custom Filtering, Validating Token with Spring cloud gateway library, Docker and Helm for accessing Server and Hystrix. Kubernetes configuration are 
					setup with Docker, Jenkins, Helm and application.yml files. The application.yml file was where I contributed the most for this project.

					<p> <b>In-App_purchase for IOS</b> <br>
						&emsp;My first task is to implement an IOS application using Xcode10 for IOS version 12 which include a purchase functionality within
						 the IOS application. The company is developing a video application called Kollus, which many famous customers such as Lotte 
						 Cinema has been using it. And I had to provide this particular service in order to make customer be more 
						 convenient on purchasing any products Catenoid provided through the application.
					</p>
					<p> 
							<b>WebView, Apache HTTP server for IOS</b> <br>
							&emsp;For WebView part, I have used knowledge from developing Web-Application such as HTML, CSS,
						 JavaScript and jQuery for this task because it is necessary to create new fundamental files
						  for website and apply it to Xcode. I have to implemented HTML, JavaScript files in order to 
						  link it to Xcode and between themselves. Most importantly,
						   the hardest part is I also needed to developed server for this site which I am not familiar. So, I studied how to use Apache HTTP server and 
						   how to apply it to Xcode, IOS devices. I also learned Angular language which is another popular 
						   web-development language, since it provided some useful libraries to develop the application
						 integrating Apache too. Lastly, I learned specific functions and how to connect Xcode to all
						  implementation of server part which is the most important. My company advisor also 
						  wanted me to write the summary of how I implemented all of them too.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>CardboardSDK for Virtual Reality IOS Application</b> <br>
						&emsp;There is GoogleVRSDK which provided some functionality for changing video to 3-dimensional video.
					 But the issue was to make cardboard cover the whole video too. So I spent a lot of time looking for
					  the best way to create it and finally found GVRSDK for creating cardboard for video. <br>
					  &emsp; Using GVRSDK is also problematic; Since the SDK is not completely developed be Google developers, t
						 here are a lot of issues for each function. For example, I could not get the “rate” of video at 
						 any moment, but I could get only the return of a function when the rate of video has changed. 
						 This brought me to the problem of how to fully control the play and pause functionality of the video.
						 And there were also some bugs occurring from multitasking of IOS devices which sent SIGKILL and the app crashed.
						 Although a lot of problems occurred, I had learned a lot about how to solve and manage it, or at least,
						 decrease possibility of having those crashes. These are very fun time for me spending these 2 months here.<br>
						 &emsp; I've also learned creating Cardboard from scratch using GLKit, OpenGLES many of their 
						functions according to <a href="https://github.com/rsanchezsaez/CardboardSDK-iOS">this github website</a> 
						and <a href="https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-ios-sdk">this too</a> I have learned a lot about how to
						construct, GLK functions and what are necessary things in order to initialize 3-dimensional object and screen.

					<p>After crawling 454 websites in the wild, canvas fingerprint and WebRTC Fingerprint were actually found. The processed were done in 
						parallel for good performance (5 threads at a time) due to the limitation of resources, the investigation took very long for each thread.
						And the fact that not many fingerprint were found would happen due to the fact that actual websites nowadays have more way for avoiding
						web fingerprint detection such as stateless nature of some fingerprint, false positive detection which should be examined in further research.
						I also need to handle false positive cases and calculate precision and recall for the fingerprint categorization.

					<!-- <p>This is my first time that I had to deal with real research paper works. I had a lot of new experiences, and it
						was also fun. Software debugging, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">Technical Debt</a>, REST API, and some of Sonar Cloud and Sonar Qube
						using Linux/Unix environments are new skills I had learned by analyzing Technical_debt and code smell. It was a very good time there!
